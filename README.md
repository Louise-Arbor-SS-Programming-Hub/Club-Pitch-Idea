# The Programming Hub

Why is description the hardest thing to come up with...

## Purpose

Enjoy, have fun, learn stuff, meet new people and leave a mark!

### How It Will Work

#### Gather People

The first step would be to bring together individuals with a basic understanding of programming. Ideal candidates should have:

- The ability to navigate online documentation and tutorials to solve coding issues.
- Basic knowledge of programming language (either Python or Java).
- A willingness to collaborate, contribute, accept mistakes and learn from others.

#### Required Tools and Platforms

To ensure the club operates smoothly, the following tools and platforms will be essential:

1. **Version Control**: Using **GitHub** for version control, ensuring that everyone can contribute and track changes efficiently.
   
2. **Communication**: A group chat platform, like **Discord**, will be our main communication hub. We'll create separate channels for discussions, debugging, and announcements.
   
3. **Project Management**: To manage tasks and assign responsibilities, we'll use **Trello**, **Notion**, or **Google Classroom** for project tracking and milestone setting.
   
4. **Web Hosting and Deployment**: Once the website is ready, we'll look into **GitHub Pages** for deployment.

5. **AI Usage**: Should be able to use AI tools like ChatGPT while understanding how the stuff is working. 
(there is no denying everyone uses AI for their projects, rather than not allowing them to use it, better to encourage them to learn while using it)


#### Roles in the Club

We’ll distribute roles based on each member’s strengths and interests:

- **Frontend Developers**: Handle the design, user interface, and user experience of the website using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
- **Backend Developers**: Focus on server-side logic, databases, and APIs using languages such as Python, or Java.

- **UI/UX Designers**: Work on the visual and interactive aspects of the website, ensuring it is user-friendly and appealing.

- **Project Managers**: Oversee the project timeline, ensuring that deadlines are met and the project is progressing smoothly.

- **QA Testers**: Ensure that all features of the website are bug-free and functional, handling testing and feedback.

#### Project Workflow

1. **Planning**: We will start with brainstorming sessions to decide on the website’s purpose, layout, and features.
   
2. **Task Assignment**: Tasks will be broken down into manageable pieces, with team members assigned based on their skill sets.

3. **Development**: Members will code, test, and refine their respective parts of the project.

4. **Review and Testing**: Regular reviews and testing will be conducted to ensure the project stays on track and issues are addressed promptly.

5. **Deployment**: Once the website is ready, we will deploy it using the selected platform.

#### Meeting Schedule

- Meetings will be held **twice or thrice a week** to discuss progress, assign tasks, and troubleshoot any challenges.
- The project is expected to **extend over two semesters**, allowing ample time for development, testing, and deployment.
  
#### Future Goals

The Programming Hub aims to provide members with opportunities to:

- Learn and improve programming skills.
- Work on real-world projects that can be added to their portfolios (or just for fun).
- Develop teamwork and communication skills in a collaborative environment.
